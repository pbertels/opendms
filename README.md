# OpenDMS: file naming convention for the Belgian construction industry

Every successful construction project involves lots of partners producing lots of documents. That's why Document Management is such an important topic in the construction industry today.

With OpenDMS (Open Document Management System), ADEB-VBA proposes a standard file naming convention that can be used on every construction project in Belgium. It was developed with input from many Belgian construction companies, Belgium's leading architects, design and engineering firms and the Belgian Building Research Institute.


## Common questions in document management

* What's the best way to name a file for important documents on a construction project? 
* Where can I find the document that contains the information I am looking for? 
* Who is responsible for the information in this document?
* What part of the building or construction is this document about?


## Pragmatic standard, co-created by the industry

We focused on making it usable for all parties and for all phases of a construction project. OpenDMS can be used from feasibility study, over design and execution, up to maintenance, and even the end-of-life stage. 

To ensure that our OpenDMS file naming convention can fit every project and every partner on the project, our new standard is flexible, orthogonal, and above all: logical.

### Flexible

OpenDMS defines a set of 7 required fields and 3 optional fields.  These fields always appear in the file name in the same fixed order. 

Fields with built-in flexibility should be fixed during project kick-off. The OpenDMS guide helps with that.

### Orthogonal

All fields in the OpenDMS standard are orthogonal. Every field expresses a different concept such that no two fields contain the same information. This way OpenDMS maximises the expressive power of the file name whilst avoiding deleterious superfluities.

### Logical

The OpenDMS file naming convention builds on international standards (ISO 19650). 
Lists of potential values for every field are constructed based on file naming conventions currently used by Belgium's leading architects, design and engineering firms, and construction companies.


## File name convention: standard &amp; extended formats

The OpenDMS file naming convention comes in 2 flavours: the standard version and the extended version. The standard version only contains the required fields and an optional textual description. The extended version also includes plan status and project phase.

Standard file names look like  
`W165-JEA-A-AIN-DR-HA01-03-short_textual_description`

Extended OpenDMS file names look like  
`W165-JEA-A-AIN-DR-HA01-03-E-1-short_textual_description`

The file name contains these fields, always in this fixed order, separated by hyphens (-). **Required fields** in bold - *optional fields* in italics. Most of the fields are to be selected from a _standard_ list (e.g. by means of a dropdown), others are project dependent and need to be agreed on during project kick-off.

- **Project** (3-10 chars): which project does this document belong to?
- **Organisation** (3-10 chars): which organisation or company is responsible for the contents of this file
- **Role** (1 [standard](#role) char): what's the role of the Organisation on this project?
- **Functional breakdown** (3 [standard](#functional) chars): what's this document about?
- **Type** (2 [standard](#type) chars): what type of information can be found in this document?
- **Spatial breakdown** (4-8 chars): where on the project does this document apply?
- **Number** (2-6 digits): number added to the file name to make a unique combination of all of the above fields
- *Plan status* (1 [standard](#status) char): status of the plan
- *Project phase* (1 [standard](#status) digit): what phase of the project does this document apply to?
- *Short description* (text without spaces): textual description that helps to identify the document's content

For each of the fields that need to follow a standard list, the possible values are explained below. *Important*: even though the fields *plan status* and *project phase* are only optional, we propose a standardised list for those fields.
